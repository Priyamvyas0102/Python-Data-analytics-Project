# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project is a Python-based internship project that demonstrates the creation of a movie recommendation system.

## Project Overview

This repository houses the codebase and resources related to the Movie Recommendation System developed during an internship project. The main objective of this project was to design and implement a movie recommendation system using Python. The recommendation system employs various algorithms and techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Variety:** The recommendation system incorporates multiple algorithms, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to provide diverse and accurate movie suggestions.

- **User Interaction:** The system offers a user-friendly interface through which users can input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations.

- **Efficiency and Scalability:** The codebase is optimized for efficiency, enabling the system to handle a growing user base and movie library without compromising performance.
